					Divie is designed to help beneficiaries in an estate efficiently divide some or all of the assets, but is not a substitute for the services of an attorney. At no time does Divie claim that the results from this Application are legally binding. Although Divie strives to create an optimized division of assets, free of competition between beneficiaries (users), there are always alternative asset divisions. If the Customer is not happy with any of the suggested divisions, he or she has the choice to work with other beneficiaries linked to the auction and come up with a different allocation.Any advice from the Application is not legal advice and therefore, if you need legal advice for your specific problem you should consult a licensed attorney in your area. This Application is not intended to replace an attorney, but is instead intended to aid a group of beneficiaries and an executor in dividing assets of an estate.</b>
